### Using Python, you can define and call functions that are specific to packages or created functions.
The main components of a function are: definition statement, the body, and the output statement
- The function header includes the def keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by parantheses, followed by a colon.
- Including functions such as round() to the return statement helps keep calculated values tidy and easy to read.
